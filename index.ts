/**
 * Expected recall probability now, given a prior distribution on it.

 * `prior` is a tuple representing the prior distribution on recall probability

 * Specifically,  it's a 3-tuple, `(alpha, beta, t)` where `alpha` and `beta`
 * parameterize a Beta distribution that is the prior on recall probability at
 * time `t`.
 *
 * `tnow` is the *actual* time elapsed since this fact's most recent review.
 *
 * Optional keyword parameter `exact` makes the return value a probability,
 * specifically, the expected recall probability `tnow` after the last review: a
 * number between 0 and 1. If `exact` is false (the default), some calculations
 * are skipped and the return value won't be a probability, but can still be
 * compared against other values returned by this function. That is, if
 *
 * > predictRecall(prior1, tnow1, True) < predictRecall(prior2, tnow2, True)
 *
 * then it is guaranteed that
 *
 * > predictRecall(prior1, tnow1, False) < predictRecall(prior2, tnow2, False)

/**
 * Update a prior on recall probability with a quiz result and time.
 *
 * `prior` is same as in `ebisu.predictRecall`'s arguments: an object
 * representing a prior distribution on recall probability at some specific time
 * after a fact's most recent review.
 *
 * `successes` is the number of times the user *successfully* exercised this
 * memory during this review session, out of `total` attempts. Therefore, `0 <=
 * successes <= total` and `1 <= total`.
 *
 * If the user was shown this flashcard only once during this review session,
 * then `total=1`. If the quiz was a success, then `successes=1`, else
 * `successes=0`.
 *
 * If the user was shown this flashcard *multiple* times during the review
 * session (e.g., Duolingo-style), then `total` can be greater than 1.
 *
 * `tnow` is the time elapsed between this fact's last review and the review
 * being used to update.
 *
 * Returns a new object (like `prior`) describing the posterior distribution of
 * recall probability after update.
 *
 * N.B. This function is tested for numerical stability for small `total < 5`. It
 * may be unstable for much larger `total`.
 *
 * N.B.2. This function may throw an assertion error upon numerical instability.
 * This can happen if the algorithm is *extremely* surprised by a result; for
 * example, if `successes=0` and `total=5` (complete failure) when `tnow` is very
 * small compared to the halflife encoded in `prior`. Calling functions are asked
 * to call this inside a try-except block and to handle any possible
 * `AssertionError`s in a manner consistent with user expectations, for example,
 * by faking a more reasonable `tnow`. Please open an issue if you encounter such
 * exceptions for cases that you think are reasonable.
